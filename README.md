Risk project

General: 
* Data collection details 
* Add BIS-BAS? 

Holt & Laury
* Timing changes (add timeout, ITI -- see slide deck)
* Beautify (hard to read now)

RiskRL
* Separate training block from main task
* Add "too slow" functionality -- this currently only happens if there is a response  
* Make sure they canâ€™t press a key too soon during the 
instructions -- perhaps add a test that they understood instructions? See supplementary in Hauser 2014 for an example 


DOSPERT 
* Separate pages for each scale so that subjects don't have to scroll down too much
* Look for function that blocks until questions are filled 
* Photos stretched
