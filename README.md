Risk project

General: 
* Full screen 
* Data collection details 

Holt & Laury
* Timing changes (add timeout, ITI -- see slide deck)
* Beautify (hard to read now)

RiskRL
* Separate training block from main task
* Put forced choices L or R 
* Increase distance between stimuli
* Make keys B and M
* Add fixation, feedback
* Need time out function - draw from a uniform distribution of 1-2 
seconds (cross is going to be on for that long) 
* Need to randomize side - if forced trial and they pick the 
wrong side, code as a 99 (because they didn’t pick wrong, perhaps 
perseveration) 
* Make sure they can’t press a key too soon during the 
instructions -- perhaps add a test that they understood instructions? See supplementary in Hauser 2014 for an example 


DOSPERT 
* Separate pages for each scale so that subjects don't have to scroll down too much
* Look for function that blocks until questions are filled 
* Photos stretched
