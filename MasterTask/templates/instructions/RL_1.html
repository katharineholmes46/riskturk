            In this experiment you will complete three separate mini-experiments. Each experiment will be prefaced by instructions that will detail what you need to do. 
        </p>

	    <p>
		    In the first mini-experiment, you will be making choices between symbols. Your goal will be to earn as many points as possible. Every 5 points you make translate into 1 cent.
	    </p>

        <p>
            You will play a game in which there are 4 unique symbols (shown below). Think of each symbol as a slot machine in a casino. It has a certain amount of points that it can reward you with. 
        </p>

        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            As you play the game, keep in mind that the points you earn for playing a slot machine depend only on the symbol, not its location on the screen, or your responses in previous trials.
